# Popup my Bookmarks
Popup my Bookmarks is a Chrome extension aims at providing a more efficient way to view and manage your bookmarks menu:

- Firefox / IE-like bookmarks menu

- Display bookmark trees side by side

- It is configurable!

- Search bookmarks with Advanced Searching Algorithm!

- Do what Bookmark manager can do and more (e.g., Sort bookmarks by name, Add separator)

- Save 24px of your vertical workspace (Rock on Chromebook!)

- No background running application, save your memory and privacy!

## Plan to do:

1. Keyboard Navigation

2. Bookmarks selector (allow drag and manage a group of bookmarks)


## What you can help:

- Translate to other languages, It's all depended on volunteers as I am not a linguist. ;-)

- Fork me on GitHub, join our development!

## Why does PmB need to 'Access your tabs and browsing activity' and 'Access your data on all websites'(optional)?

- 'Add current page' and 'Open bookmark in tab' require permission - 'Access your tabs and browsing activity'

- 'Bookmarklet support'(optional) requires permission - 'Access your data on all websites'(optional)
